# ts-command-line-args

This is a fork of the [ts-command-line-args](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-command-line-args) package, which can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/Roaders/ts-command-line-args).

We are primarily using this fork for the parse logic functionality and to ensure compatibility with both CommonJS (CJS) and ECMAScript Modules (ESM). The original package did not fully support both module systems, which was a requirement for our monorepo. We are not actively tracking changes made to the original package as our focus is on maintaining and using the core parsing capabilities.
